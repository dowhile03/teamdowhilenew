        Today’s technology is a booming market full of exciting and innovative products and new learning opportunities. With
        technology as a major consumer of our time and also an exciting experience in our world today, are you motivated to
        generate something new?<br>
        Technology affects people all over the world. Advances in technology have made our countries safer and our lives
        easier, they have also negatively affected our lives. Technology have brought us online banking, smart cars, smart
        TVs, lightning fast computers, and the virtual reality. Also there include cyber warfare, hackers, identity theft,
        cyber stalking, and a host of other bad things. <br>
        The society has been changed with the evolution of technology. Life was burdensome and everyday chores consumed too
        much of our time, before the advent of modern day technology. The access to education, medicine, industry,
        transportation etc. has been simplified due to development in modern day technology. Due to the convenience and
        efficiency provided by technology, our lives have improved. Information technology give a new face to traditional
        libraries that include both digital collections and traditional, fixed media collections. We know that traditional
        libraries are limited by its storage space, but the digital information requires little space to contain
        information, so digital libraries have the potential to store more documents. The use of information technology in
        digital libraries that will increase the number of users and increased the expectations of the users.</p>

      <p class="font1">  A blockchain, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked
        using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,a timestamp, and transaction
        data. A blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record
        transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".For use as a distributed ledger,
        a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node
        communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively
        without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain
        records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing
        system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.
        Blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the
        public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to date.
        The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem
        without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications, and
        blockchains that are readable by the public are widely used by cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is considered a type
        of payment rail. Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Computerworld called the marketing of such
        blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil".

      <p class="font1">  Blockchain technology is revolutionary. It will make life simpler and safer, changing the way personal information
        is stored and how transactions for good and services are made. Blockchain technology creates a permanent and
        immutable record of every transaction. This impenetrable digital ledger makes fraud, hacking, data theft, and
        information loss impossible. The technology will affect every industry in the world, including manufacturing,
        retail, transportation, healthcare, and real estate Companies as Google, IBM, Microsoft, American Express, Walmart,
        Nestle, Chase, Intel, Hitachi, and Dole are all working to become early adopters of blockchain. Nearly $400 trillion
        across various industries is set to be transformed by blockchain.
