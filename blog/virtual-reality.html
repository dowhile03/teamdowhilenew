        As the name suggests <b>virtual reality</b> can be called a <b>‘near- reality’</b>. What we experience from our day to
        day life is all
        due to our sense organs. These sense organs sense the things going on in our surroundings and help us work in
        accordance. That is, all that we perceive with our sense organs is real to us. A similar visualization, in which you
        think that things going on are real but they aren’t real can be called as virtual reality.<br>
        <b>A three- dimensional (3-D), computer- built environment that can interact with a human and can completely immerse in the
            surroundings</b> can be termed as virtual reality. This environment can perform a series of tasks and thus, can take
        technology to the highest height. Nowadays, virtual reality is gaining a high popularity, extending the market for the
        technology lovers. It is often been used for making interactive video games, 3-D movies and television programs, but
        they cannot called as the original virtual reality. This is because such things are obviously ahead of virtual devices
        but not near the reality.<br></p>

       <p class="font1"> We are going into virtual reality but there are many challenges to face to make it similar to real surroundings for
        humans. The major challenge is immersion in the environment – besides looking 180 degrees around, a human also have the
        peripheral vision. Less availability of investments and knowledge in this field are some other barriers.
        Today’s VR also require a source of the content and user devices which include headsets, special gloves, goggles and
        much more that provide realistic, natural and high quality images so as to experience the highest possible interaction
        with the virtual world. We can achieve interaction with various modes like head tracking, eye tracking and motion
        tracking.<br>
        Some of the top companies providing virtual reality are VironIT, Next/Now, OTR, Groove Jones, and Mobi Lab. The main aim
        now is to make VR cost effective so that it can used in several work places including educational, medical and research
        related areas, thus, increasing the interest and skills in the world. Virtual reality was once a dream that is becoming
        a reality with time and can even be known as the greatest boon of science !!!
