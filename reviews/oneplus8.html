    <p class="a">Oneplus started it’s journey with  an unheard of tag of the <mark>'Flagshipkiller'</mark>. They provided phones with high end specs at a much affordable and cheaper prices than the other flagships that were available in the market at that time..They achieved so by cutting few corners which they felt were not very important to add to the overall user experience. Their core focus was on providing top of line processor coupled with a great user interface. This helped OnePlus to grow as a brand.<br>
       Now we have OnePlus 8 series, OnePlus' latest addition to it’s premium lineup and it's safe to say that this 8 series is indeed a flagship rather than a flagship killer(heck, OnePlus 8 pro has all the features and specs that you expect from a flagship at a much cheaper price than those compared to Samsung's.)<br> 
      Today I will be reviewing OnePlus 8 mentioning all it’s pros and cons so that you can decide whether this latest offering from OnePlus is worth your attention and money. I will be dividing my review into several sections so that it's easier to understand each and every aspect of the phone.</p>

   <h1>BUILD QUALITY AND IN HAND FEEL: </h1>

       <p class="a"> OnePlus 8 indeed feels like a premium device with it’s glass sandwich design and curved back and curved screen in the front. Both the front and back is protected with <mark>gorrila glass 6 </mark> therefore minor bumps and falls will do no harm to the back or to the screen and getting the glass scratched will take an unusual amount of effort so you get that aspect covered to so in terms of build it’s as good as you can currently get.<br>
      Now the device is pretty slim and the work done by OnePlus on the weight distribution of the phone is commendable. Even though the phone weighs<mark> 186gms </mark>it feels much lighter in hand and  it sports a 6.55 inches screen but in a firm factor that makes the phone comfortable to hold and use without making you feel like you have weights attached to your finger.<br>
      The only fault that I can pick out in the build is that OnePlus 8 has<mark> no official IP68 water and dust resistant rating</mark> so technically it won’t be a very good idea if you decide to go for a swim with your phone in your pocket. But there are rubber casings around the Sim card tray and speaker grills to prevent water from seeping into the phone. So what I think is that OnePlus put efforts into making the phone waterproof but didn’t get it certified to save on some cost.<br></p>
  <h1> DISPLAY AND SOUND:</h1>
   OnePlus is known for its good displays and this time too OnePlus has knocked it out of the park with it’s super AMOLED display one OnePlus 8. The display size is 6.55 inches and it has a tiny punch hole  on the top left side which you after sometime forget that it even exists. It blends seemlessly with the content on your screen and it never felt like distracting or if it was in the way of the screen's content. OnePlus has used a high quality super AMOLED screen with 
   it’s 8 model that has a peak brightness of 1000 nits. Thus, you can easily see the contents of the screen under direct sunlight without straining your eyes. 
   The viewing angles are perfect and you can see the screen even from the harshest of angles. Having an <mark>HDR 10+ screen </mark> doesn’t hurt and adds to the overall beauty of the display
     It is a FHD+ screen and the colors it shows are punchy and vibrant so consuming multimedia on this phone will definitely be a pleasant experience. This coupled with <mark>Dolby Atmos supported dual stereo speakers</mark>(one on bottom and one on the front) makes it one of the best speakers available in a phone right now and you have to listen to it to experience how good it is. Base, treble,highs and lows all are delivered crisply and perfectly through the speaker.
   Though you have to keep in mind that there is <mark>no 3.5mm audio jack </mark> either you will have to buy wireless earbuds separately or use a type C to 3.5mm dongle.

   <h1>PORTS AND SENSORS:</h1>
  <p class="a"> Of course it’s a flagship device and comes with all the sensors (including NFC). Having widevine L1 support means you can stream Netflix and Amazon prime content in FHD thereby making complete use of that AMOLED display. It has <mark> WiFi 6.0 support along with Bluetooth 5.1 so connectivity</mark> will be a breeze and you won’t face any issues whatsoever.<br>
       It is a dual SIM device with <mark>no option to increase the storage by inserting an external micro SD card.</mark> The call connectivity and internet stability won’t make you complain and they won’t create any troubles.<br>
     The in display fingerprint sensor and the face scanner are reliable and quick so you won’t face any issues there</p>
   <h1>BATTERY:</h1>
     <p class="a">OnePlus 8 has a <mark>4,400 mAh battery</mark> that can easily give you a screen on time of 7-8 hours and if you are an average user then it will end the day with still 20% battery left. Though if you play slot of games then the battery will drain faster as is the case with any phone. But you don’t have to worry if you run out of battery because the Warp charger included with the device charges the phone in little above an hour with an <mark>output wattage of 30 watts.</mark>
   So in terms of battery life and battery charging it’s pretty safe to say that oneplus 8 has got you covered.</p>
     <h1>PERFORMANCE:</h1>
   <p class="a">OnePlus 8 has the latest chip from Qualcomm that’s <mark>snapdragon 865</mark> which is also a 5G chip making OnePlus 8 a 5G and future ready phone. The chip is powerful enough to run every game at it’s highest settings without dropping any frames or heating beyond the limit of comfortability. I <mark>play pubg at HDR+ Extreme settings</mark> and it maintains frame rates and the gameplay is battery smooth. Obviously, in day to day task you won’t experience the slightest of hiccups as SD 865 coupled with 90Hz display and Oxygen OS makes navigating through the phone a buttery smooth experience.
     The phone has an Antutu Benchmark score of above 5.75 lacs .All in thanks to it’s processor,LP DDR4X ram,UFS 3.0 storage and Oxygen OS(which in my opinion is far superior and better than any other custom OS).</p>
   <h1>CAMERA:</h1>
   <p class="a">OnePlus 8 has <mark>triple camera setup</mark> at the back with the main camera being a 48 MP Sony IMX 586 sensor with a 12 MP ultrawide camera and a mere 2MP macro camera. The inclusion of Macro camera doesn’t make any sense as the pictures clicked by it are not very good and the primary camera can take better macro pictures. Maybe it was done by OnePlus so that they can say that they have 3 cameras in their phones.<br>
   The pictures captured using the other 2 cameras are very good with a lot of details and punchy colors to make the picture look more appealing. The dynamic range and white balance too is maintained properly. Though for the price paid for the phone the camera's performance could have been a tad bit better.<br>
      But, when it comes to video recording, OnePlus again knocks it out of the park as it captures almost cinematic level <mark>videos at 4k 60 FPS </mark> and it  also has Optical image stabilisation for further improving the video and night picture quality.<br>
     The front camera too does a pretty good job and there isn’t much to complain there.</p>
