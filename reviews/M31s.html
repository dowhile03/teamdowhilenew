        <!--Introduction-->
        <p>

        </p>

        <p>
           For the past few years, Samsung has received a lot of love,appreciation and praise for its Galaxy M & A series of smartphones. The tech giant has seen itself make deep inroads into the budget and mid-segment of the market with this series of
           phones that primarily focuses on impressing with its big battery, uncomplicated design, and beautiful displays.Their primary focus was never on processoes as all the M series smatrtphones ship with the below average exynos processoes.
        </p>
        <p>
           Late last month, Samsung added to the line-up by launching the all-new Galaxy M31s smartphone. The phone comes as the successor to 
            the much loved and bought Galaxy M31 in India, which was launched by the company only a few months ago in February this year. The Galaxy M31s brings a number of new
           features, among which are its massive 6000mAh battery pack and sports a 64-megapixel lens-based quad-camera set-up. The phone has been announced as an Amazon exclusive, which will also be sold through Samsung's website.
        </p>
        <p>
           The Galaxy M31s has been announced in two variants with 6GB+128GB or 8GB+128GB RAM and storage options. The two variants will be available 
            in Mirage Black and Mirage Blue colour options, with the lower-end variant retailing for a price of Rs 19,999, while the higher-end model coming at Rs 21,999.
        </p>

        <!--Design and display-->
        <h3>DISPLAY AND DESIGN</h3>
        <p>
          <fig>
            <img src="../images/reviewImages/des1.webp" width="250px" height="150px">

            <figcaption>Samsung M31s Display and Design</figcaption>
          </fig>
        </p>

        <p>
          Samsung is well known for its displays and they are considered among the best that any company has to offer.Even other companies be it OnePlus or apple
          use displays that are manufactured by Samsung.So in terms of display Samsung is the unprecedented king and it is the only brand that
          provides AmoLed displays under the price bracket of INR 20000.So if you are looking for a phone with a bright display having punchy colors
          and good visibility under direct sunlight and your budget is under 20k then it can't get any better than M31s.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing to keep in mind about M31s display is that it does not support any higher refresh rate and it runs on the usual 60Hz rather than 
          the new usual 90Hz or 120Hz display which is becoming common even in the price bracket of 15k. But the amoled screen of samsung has an edge over the
          IPS LCD displays in the same price range.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming to the design and build quality,the entire phone is built of plastic with an unremovable back. At this price range we have seen phones
          from chinese manufacturers having a glass sandwich design but Samsung has cut corners giving a plastic back. If its any consolation,
          the plastic is certainly of a superior quality than its predecessor M31 and all the phones of M series.
        </p>
        <p>
            The back panel is still a smudge magnet, and quite reflective because of its glossy finish, but overall, it impresses from the moment you lay your eyes on it. The uncomplicated 
            design is as classy as they come, and complete with the moderately
            sized quad-camera set-up at the back, helps the Galaxy M31s stand out as one of the better-looking devices in the segment.
        </p>

        <h3>Specifications,Features and Battery</h3>
        <fig>
          <img src="../images/reviewImages/specs1.jfif" height="150px" width="250px">
          <img src="../images/reviewImages/specs 2.jfif" height="150px" width="250px">
          <figcaption>M31s Specs</figcaption>
        </fig>

        <p>
            Under the hood, the Galaxy M31s brings with itself an octa-core SoC and up to 8GB of RAM on the phone. The chipset is 2.3GHz Exynos 9611
             octa-core chipset fabricated using a 10nm FinFet process.  The chipset houses a Mali G72 MP3 GPU and is paired with 6GB of RAM and up to 128GB of storage.

            Don't be surprised if this chipset feels very familiar. This is because the company has earlier used the same chip on the Galaxy M31 and even last year's M30s, 
            as well as the more recently launched Galaxy A51.
         </p>  
         <p> 
            The chipset is quite competent at most tasks, however, as we have found before, it is not the safest bet if you plan to use your new phone
             for heavy gaming, or subject it to the ire of stress tests. As processors go, this chipset is not the most powerful for handling performance-oriented tasks.
            
            Having said that, it's still great at handling basic apps of daily use, good at handling multitasking or even playing graphics-intensive games such as Call of Duty Mobile at 
            medium graphics settings. However, the fact that this is a year-old chipset, it still raises some questions over how future proof the chipset is going forward.

            Its high time that Samsung retires this chipset as any of the Samsung's phone between the price range of 13k to 25k have the same chipset
            delivering more or less a similar performance with minor optimization changes but the processor heats with an hour of gaming and thermal
            throttling is evident.
            So if performance is your priority, then the Snapdragon 730G present in Poco X2 will be a much better choice.
        </p>
        <p>
             The fact that that the phone gets a massive 6000mAh pack helps it last almost two days on a single charge. However, once it does run out of juice, charging it takes very little time as it
             supports 25W fast charging and also reverse charging to juice up other phones and devices.
        </p>

        <!--Software-->
        <h3>Software</h3>

        </fig>
        <p>
            The Galaxy M31s also brings one of the most refined UI experiences available to Android users at present. The phone ships with One UI 2 that’s 
            based on Android 10 and is the latest version of Samsung’s revamped One UI software.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite a little bloatware, it’s generally clean and brings to the table a lag-free, smooth experience that not only works well but also looks premium while doing so. The UI of the device 
            also brings some impressive gains when it comes to battery life to the table.
        </p>

        <!--Cameras-->
        <h3>Cameras</h3>
        <fig>
            <img src="../images/reviewImages/cam.jfif" height="150px" width="250px">
            <img src="../images/reviewImages/cam2.jfif" height="150px" width="250px">
            <img src="../images/reviewImages/cam.jfif" height="150px" width="250px">
            <figcaption>M31s Cameras</figcaption>
        </fig>

        <p>
            The cameras on-board are a quad rear camera setup that includes a 64-megapixel primary sensor. Other sensors in this set-up include a 12-megapixel sensor with an f/2.2 ultra-wide-angle lens, a 5-megapixel depth sensor, and another 5-megapixel Macro sensor with an f/2.4 aperture.

           The Galaxy M31s does quite a good job with the cameras. For the price, the M31s houses one of the better cameras in the segment. This is especially true for the daylight performance of the primary camera of the device, 
            which manages to click some really impressive shots with accurate colours and enough details to make the pictures stand out.
            
            The phone's primary camera is quick to focus on subjects and the device also features fast shutter speed to ensure that pictures come out blur-free in most cases. This impressive daytime performance 
            is also replicated by the ultra-wide lens which again manages to capture a lot of detail and reproduce accurate colours. The depth sensor on the device also feels above par, with shots clicked using it coming out really nice.
            
            The low-light performance of these lenses, especially the ultra-wide lens leaves a little to be desired, but overall, when put in perspective with the competition and seen in the context of the price point the phone retails at, the Galaxy M31s appears to justify its performance.

        </p>
        <p>
            On the front, the phone sports a camera that features a 32-megapixel lens. This lens captures accurate skin colours and enough detail to make selfies look great. Thankfully, the front camera also doesn't smoothen the textures too much, thereby helping retain skin detail in pictures clicked by the phone's front camera.

            The Galaxy M31s also supports a number of premium software features on both the front and the rear cameras. Features such as Single Take which were first introduced with the Galaxy S20 series of phones now finds a place on this mid-segment device, giving the Galaxy M31s an advantage over competing phones. There are also other features 
            like Night Mode and Macro Mode among others included in the phone's camera software.
        </p>
        
        <!--Final opinions-->
        <h3>Final Opinions</h3>

        <p>
            The Samsung Galaxy M31s has a lot going for it. The phone brings a big display, which both looks and performs quite well. There's also a big 6000mAh battery and 25W fast charging to complete the package. And if you were still left unsure, the phone also impresses with its
             64-megapixel lens-based quad cameras that are equipped to get the job done under all scenarios.

             Yet, Samsung's decision to launch the phone with the Exynos 9611 SoC may prove to be the Achilles heel of the device. While the chipset is still quite competent, the fact that this very chipset is available on much cheaper
             Samsung smartphones may not fly well buyers. And then there's also the competition to deal with. But before the Galaxy M31s becomes a hit, it will have to take on competing
             devices such as the Redmi K20, which despite being a year old still remains quite popular with buyers.
